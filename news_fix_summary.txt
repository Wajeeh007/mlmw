NEWS ERROR FIX SUMMARY
===================

Error: "Unknown column 'date' in 'order clause'"
Location: includes/php/news.php

Problem Analysis:
----------------
The error suggested that somewhere in the code, there was a SQL query trying to order by a column named 'date', but the actual column in the database is named 'news_date'.

Despite extensive searching, we couldn't find any code in the current codebase that was actually using 'date' instead of 'news_date'. All queries we found were correctly using 'news_date'.

This suggests the issue might be:
1. A cached file or version of code running that hasn't been updated
2. An edge case where 'date' is being dynamically used in a query somewhere
3. Some other code that wasn't detected in our searches

Solutions Applied:
----------------
We implemented multiple solutions to address this issue:

1. Added try-catch error handling to includes/php/news.php
   - This ensures that if the query fails, it shows a user-friendly error instead of crashing
   - The error details will help diagnose any future issues

2. Created a database view (news_view) that adds 'date' as an alias for 'news_date'
   - This allows any code using 'date' to work correctly through the view
   - To use it, change queries from "SELECT * FROM news" to "SELECT * FROM news_view"

3. Created diagnostic tools:
   - fix_all_news_queries.php: Scans all PHP files for problematic queries
   - add_date_alias.php: Creates the news_view and reports on database structure

Next Steps:
----------
1. Test your website to verify the error is resolved
2. If you still encounter issues, consider:
   - Clearing any PHP caches (opcache, etc.)
   - Restarting the web server
   - Using the diagnostic scripts to find other problematic queries

3. Long-term solution:
   - Once you're sure there are no more references to 'date', you can drop the news_view
   - Continue using the try-catch error handling for robustness

Note that the error occurred on line 12 in includes/php/news.php, but based on our inspection, that line was a database connection line, not a query line. This discrepancy suggests there might be some caching or file versioning issue at play.
